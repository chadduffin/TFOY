# The Fellowships of Yendor

**The Fellowships of Yendor**, TFOY, is a roguelike game aimed to become one of the more popular of the genre.

>
**Roguelike** is a subgenre of role-playing games characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated game levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and permanent death of the player-character.

TFOY will be made using modern programming paradigms. It will combine many of the favorite aspects of current roguelikes whilst still being influenced by my own desires of the game.
